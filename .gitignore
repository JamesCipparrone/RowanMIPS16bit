# The .gitignore file specifies files and filetypes that git and GitHub
# will ignore and leave out of the repository. 
# 
# The asterisk '*' is a wildcard character that substitutes for any number of 
# characters (0 or more). So if "*.txt" is on a line by itself, all plain text 
# files will be ignored.

# How to ignore entire folders:

# Quartus II makes backup copies of source code files. 
*.bak

# Quartus II also can generate large numbers of large files, so 
# include those filetypes below, if you run into them. 


# Windows generates these files: 
thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Sometimes Vim leaves leftover files after it closes: 
*.un~
*.swp
*.*~


## 	An example from Git: 
# git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# 	Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# 	For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# 	exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
 *.[oa]
# *~
